        "####ANSWER 2\n",
        "The size of training and validation sets combined should cover the majority percentage of data when compared to the test set. The more training done, the better the validation set's accuracy. And the better the accuracy of the validation set, the better the accuracy on the test set.\n",

        "####ANSWER 3\n",
        "I would say it would depend on the quantity of data items present in the dataset. If the dataset is large enough, then the validation set size need not be expressed in percentage, but rather in numbers. We could use a number like 10,000 or 20,000 items -- it depends on the vastness (variance) of data samples in the dataset.\n",
